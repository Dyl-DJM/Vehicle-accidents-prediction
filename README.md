# Vehicle gravity accidents prediction

A project as a data analyst (introduction) which made us work on a dataset about vehicles accidents that occurred in 2021. Based on these data, we were asked to make models of prediction that could tell an accident gravity (0 up to 4) by analysing its information (place in the vehicle, type of vehicle, sex of the victim, its age...)

This is a research project based on the introduced concepts of data analysis we studied, we wanted to divide it in 3 main parts :

- Data visualization
- Use of many different models/algorithms already implemented in Python libraries 
- Making of our neuronal network

The whole work was done by using Python and its libraries.






## Requirements

To make this project run, jupyter notebook, python 3.8, python libraries must be installed.

Moreover, Anaconda must be installed to run the following commands.

### 1 - Jupyter notebook

To **install** Jupyter notebook you can run the following command :

```bash
pip install notebook
```

To **launch** the notebook :


```bash
jupyter notebook
```



### 2 - Create a conda environment

To create a virtual env that allows to use some python libraries we use the datascience.yml file.

```bash
conda env create --name envname --file=datascience.yml
```

### 3 - Use of the conda environment

**Enter the environment**
```bash
conda activate datascience
```

**Quit the environment**
```bash
conda deactivate
```
## Optimizations

The models could give better performances. We plan to fix the bug by finding a way to remove the "None" value without deleting the whole row.
